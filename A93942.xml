            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honourable, and the reſt, you are now come to convey me to my death: I am willing to die, which is a thing no more than all our Predeceſſors have done, and a debt that our Poſterity muſt in their due time diſcharge, which ſince it can be no way avoyded, it ought the leſſe to be feared; for that which is common to all, ought not to be intollerable to any: It is the Law of Nature, the tribute of the fleſh, remedy from all worldly cares and troubles; and to the truly penitent, a perfect path to bleſſedneſſe. And there is but one death, though ſeverall wayes unto it: mine is not naturall, but enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Law and Iuſtice: It hath been ſaid that the Lawes vex one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the meaner ſort of people, but the mighty are able to defend them: it is not ſo with me, for to the Law I ſubmit my ſelfe, and confeſſe that I receive nothing but Iuſtice: for he that politikly intendeth good to a Common-weale, may be called a juſt man, but he that practiſeth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his owne profit, or any other ſiniſter ends, may be well tearmed a delinquent perſon; neither is delay in puniſhment any priviledge for pardon. And moreover, I ingenuouſly confeſſe with <hi>Cicero,</hi> That the death of the bad is the ſafety of the good that be alive.</p>
                  <p>Let no man truſt either in the favour of his Prince, the friendſhip and conſanguinity of his Peeres, much leſſe in his owne wiſedome and knowledge, of which I ingenuouſly confeſſe I have been too confident. Kings, as they are men before God, ſo they are Gods before men, and I may ſay with a great man once in this Kingdome, <hi>Had I ſtrived to obey my God as faithfully, as I ſought to honour my King diligently, I had ſtood, and not fallen.</hi> Moſt happy and fortunate is that Prince, who is as much for his juſtice feared, as for his goodneſſe beloved: For the greater that Princes are in power above other, the more they ought in vertue to excell other; and ſuch is the Royall Soveraigne whom I late ſerved.</p>
                  <p>For my Peeres, the correſpondence that I had with them during my proſperity, was to me very delightfull and pleaſing, and here they have commiſerated my ruine, I have plentifully found, who (for the moſt generous of them) I may boldly ſay, though they have deteſted the fact, yet they have pittied the perſon delinquent; the firſt in their loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the laſt in their Charity: ingenuouſly confeſſing, that never any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:137087:3"/> or Peere of my rank, had ever that helpe of Counſell, that benefit of time, or a more free and legall tryall than I have had: in the like whereof, none of my predeceſſors hath had ſo much favour from his Prince, ſo much ſufferance from the people; in which I comprehend the underſtanding Commons, not the many headed Monſter, Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: But I have offended, am ſentenced, and muſt now ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>And for my too much confidence in my ſuppoſed wiſdom &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, therein have bin the moſt deceived: for he is wiſe to himſelf, that knowes by others faults to correct his owne offences: to be truely wiſe is to be Secretaries to our ſelves; for it is meere folly to reveale our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate thoughts to ſtrangers: wiſdom is the moſt precious Gem with which the mind can be adorned, and learning the moſt famous thing for which a man ought to be eſteemed, and true wiſdome teacheth us to doe well, as to ſpeake well: in the firſt I have failed, for <hi>the wiſdome of man is fooliſhneſſe with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For knowledge, it is a thing indifferent both to good and evill, but the beſt knowledge is for a man to know himſelfe; hee that doth ſo ſhall eſteeme of himſelfe but little, for he conſidereth from whence hee came, and whereto he muſt goe, he regardeth not the vaine pleaſures of this life, he exalteth God, and ſtrives to live in his feare; but hee that knoweth not himſelfe, is wilfull in his own wayes, unprofitable in his life, unfortunate in his death, and ſo am I. But the reaſon why I ſought to attaine unto it, was this: I have read that he that knoweth not that which he ought to know, is a bruit beaſt among men; hee that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more than he ought to know, is a man amongſt beaſts: but hee that knoweth all that may be known, is a God amongſt men. To this I much aſpired, in this I much failed; <hi>Vanity of vanities, all is but vanity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have heard the people clamour and cry out, ſaying, That through my occaſion the times are bad, I wiſh that when I am dead they may prove better: moſt true it is, that there is at this time a great ſtorme impending (God in his mercy avert it.) And ſince it is my particular lot, like <hi>Ionah,</hi> to be caſt into the ſea, I ſhall thinke my life well ſpent, to appeaſe Gods wrath, and ſatisfie the peoples malice.</p>
                  <p>O what is eloquence more than ayre? faſhioned with an articulate and diſtinct ſound, when it is a ſpeciall vertue to ſpeake little and well, and ſilence is oft the beſt Oratory; for fools in their dumbneſſe may be accounted wiſe: It hath power to make a good matter ſeeme bad, and a bad cauſe appeare good: but mine was to me unprofitable, and like the Cypreſſe trees, which are great and tall, but altogether without fruit.</p>
                  <p>What is honour? but the firſt ſtep to diſquietneſſe, and power is ſtill
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:137087:3"/> waited on by envy, neither hath it any priviledge againſt infamy. It is held to be the chiefe part of honour, for a man to joyne to his office and calling; curteſie and affability, commiſeration and pitty: for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he draweth to him with a kind of compulſion, the hearts of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. But that was the leaſt part of my ſtudy, which now makes me call to minde, that the greater the perſons are in authority, the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they are catcht in any delinquency, and their ſmalleſt crimes are thought to be Capitall, the ſmalleſt ſpot ſeems great in the fineſt linen, and the leaſt flaw is ſooneſt found in the richeſt Diamond. But high and Noble ſpirits finding themſelves wounded, grieve not ſo much at their owne paine and perplexity, as at the deriſion and ſcoffes of their enemy: but for mine own part, though I might have many in my life, I hope to find none in my death.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt other things which pollute and contaminate the minds of great ſpirits, there is none more hainous then Ambition, which is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome unacompanied with Avarice: Such to poſſeſſe their ends, care not to violate the Lawes of Religion, and Reaſon, and to breake the bonds of Modeſty and Equity, with the neareſt tyes of Conſanguinity, and Amity; of which as I have beene guilty, ſo I crave at Gods hands forgiveneſſe. It is a Maxime in Philoſophy, that ambitious men can be never good Counſellors to Princes; the deſire of having more is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to great Lords, and a deſire of Rule a great cauſe of their Ruine.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, I am now the hopeleſſe Preſident, may I be to you all an happy example: For Ambition devoureth gold, and drinketh blood, and climbeth ſo high by other mens heads, that at the length in the fall, it breaketh its owne neck: therefore it is better to live in humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, than in high care and trouble: For more precious is want with honeſty, than wealth with infamy: For what are we but meere Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, which in a ſerene Element aſcend high, and upon an inſtant, like Smoake vaniſh into nothing: or like ſhips without Pilots, toſt up and downe upon the Seas by contrary winds and tempeſts. But the good husbandman thinkes better of thoſe eares of Corne, which bow down, and grow crooked, than thoſe which are ſtraight and upright, becauſe he is aſſured to finde more ſtore of Grain in the one than in the other. This all men know, yet of this, how few make uſe: The defect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of muſt be now my pain: may my ſuffering prove to others profit.</p>
                  <p>For what hath now the favour of my Prince, the familiarity with my Peeres, the volubility of a tongue, the ſtrength of my memory, my learning, or knowledge, my honours, or Offices, my power, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, my riches, and treaſure, (all theſe the ſpeciall gifts, both of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Fortune) what have all theſe profited me? Bleſſings I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:137087:4"/> though by God beſtowed upon man, yet not all of them together upon many: yet by the divine Providence, the moſt of them met in me: of which had I made happy uſe, I might ſtill have flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſht, who now am forced immaturely to fall.</p>
                  <p>I now could wiſh, (but that <hi>utinam</hi> is too late) that God with his outward goodneſſe towards me had ſo commixed his inward grace, that I had chuſed the <hi>medium</hi> path, neither inclining to the right hand, nor deviating to the left; but like <hi>Icarus</hi> with my waxen wings, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by too low a flight to moiſten them with the Waves: I ſoared too high, and too neare the Sun, by which they being melted, I aiming at the higheſt, am precipitated to the loweſt, and am made a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prey to the Waters: But I who before built my houſe upon the ſand, have now ſetled my hopes upon the Rock my Saviour: by whoſe only merits my ſole truſt is, that whatſoever becomes of my body, yet in this boſome my ſoule may be ſanctuaried.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nimrod</hi> would have built a Tower to reach up to heaven, and called it <hi>Babel;</hi> but God turned it to the confuſion of Languages, and diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the people. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> kept the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in Bondage and after having freed them, in his great pride would have made them his prey; but God gave them a dry and miraculous paſſage, and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> and his hoaſt a watry Sepulchre. <hi>Belſhazzer</hi> feaſted his Princes and Proſtitutes, who drunke healths in the Veſſels taken from the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but the hand of God writ upon the wall, <hi>Mene, Tekel, Phoras,</hi> and that night before morning, was both his kingdome and life taken from him: Thus God lets men go on a great while in their own devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but in the end it proves their own ruine and deſtruction, never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering them to effect their deſired purpoſes: therefore let none preſume upon his power, glory in his greatneſſe, or be too confident in his riches: Theſe things were written for our Inſtruction, of which the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving may make uſe, the dying cannot; but wit and unfruitfull wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome are the next neighbours to folly.</p>
                  <p>There can be no greater vanity in the world, than to eſteeme the world, which regardeth no man; and to make ſlight account of God who greatly reſpecteth all men; and there can be no greater folly in man, than by much Travell to encreaſe his goods, and pamper his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and in the interim with vain delights and pleaſures, to loſe his ſoul. It is a great folly in any man to attempt a bad beginning, in hope of good ending; and to make that proper to one, which was before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, is meere indiſcretion, and the beginning of diſcord, which I poſitively wiſh may end in this my puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>O how ſmall a proportion of earth will containe my body, when
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:137087:4"/> my high minde could not be confined within the ſpacious compaſſe of two Kingdomes? But my houre draweth on, and I conclude with the Pſalmiſt, not aiming at any one man in particular, but ſpeaking for all in generall: <hi>How long will you Iudges be corrupted? how long will yee ceaſe to give true Iudgement? &amp;c. Bleſſed is the man that doth not walke in the Councell of the wicked, nor ſtand in the way of ſinners, nor ſit in the ſeat of the ſcornfull, therefore they ſhall not ſtand in the Iudgement, nor ſinners in the aſſembly of the righteous, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lord Primate of <hi>Ireland</hi> (and my Lords, and the reſt of theſe Gentlemen) it is a very great comfort to me, to have your Lordſhip by mee this day, in regard I have been knowne to you a long time: I ſhould be very glad to obtain ſo much ſilence, as to be heard a few words, but I doubt I ſhall not; my Lord I come hither by the good will and pleaſure of Almighty God, to pay that laſt debt I owe to ſin, which is death, and by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of that God to riſe again through the merits of Chriſt Jeſus to eternall glory; I wiſh I had been private, that I might have been heard; My Lord, if I might bee ſo much
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:137087:5"/> beholding to you, that I might uſe a few words, I ſhould take it for a very great curteſie; My Lord, I come hither to ſubmit to that judgement which hath paſt againſt me, I doe it with a very quiet and contented minde, I doe freely forgive all the world, a forgiveneſſe that is not ſpoken from teeth outward (as they ſay) but from the heart; I ſpeake it in the preſence of Almighty God, before whom I ſtand, that there is not ſo much as a diſpleaſing thought in mee ariſing to any creature; I thanke God I may ſay truly, and my Conſcience beares me witneſſe, that in all my ſervices ſince I have had the honour to ſerve his Majeſty in any em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, I never had any thing in my heart, but the joynt and individuall proſperity of King and People; if it have been my hap to be miſconſtrued, it is the common porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of us all while we are in this life, the righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is hereafter, here we are ſubject to error, and apt to be misjudged one of another; there is one thing I deſire to cleere my ſelfe of, and I am very confident, I ſpeake it with ſo much cleareneſſe, that I hope I ſhall have your Chriſtian charity in the beliefe of it; I did alwaies ever thinke the Parliaments of England, were the happieſt Conſtitutions that any Kingdome, or any Nation lived under, and under God the meanes of making King and People happy, ſo far have I been from being againſt Parliaments; for my death, I here acquit all the world, and pray God heartily to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them; and in particular, my Lord Primate, I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glad that his Majeſty is pleaſed to conceive me not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting ſo ſevere, and heavy a puniſhment as the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of this ſentence; I am very glad, and infinitely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in this mercy of his, and beſeech God to turne it to him, that he may finde mercy when he hath moſt need of it; I wiſh this Kingdome all the proſperity and happineſſe in the world: I did it living, and now dying it is my wiſh, I doe now profeſſe it from my heart, and doe moſt humbly recommend it unto every man here, and wiſh every man to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:137087:5"/> lay his hand upon his heart, and conſider ſeriouſly whether the beginning of the happineſſe of a People ſhould bee written in letters of Blood, I feare you are in a wrong way, and I deſire Almighty God that no one drop of my Blood may riſe up in judgement againſt you.</p>
                  <p>(My Lord,) I profeſſe my ſelfe a true and obedient Son to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> to that <hi>Church</hi> wherein I was borne, and wherein I was bred; <hi>proſperity</hi> and <hi>happineſſe,</hi> be ever to it: and whereas it hath been ſaid that I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to Popery, if it be an Objection worth anſwering, let me ſay truly, that from the time ſince I was one and twenty yeares of age, till this houre, now going upon 49. I never had thought in my heart, to doubt of the truth of my Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in <hi>England:</hi> and never any had the boldneſſe to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt to me the contrary, to the beſt of my remembrance; and ſo being reconciled to the mercies of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> my Saviour, into whoſe boſome I hope ſhortly to be gather'd to thoſe eternall happineſſes that ſhall never have end. I deſire heartily the forgiveneſſe of every man, both for any raſh or unadviſed word, or deed, and deſire your Prayers: And ſo my Lords farewell, farewell all the things of this world, LORD ſtrengthen my faith, give me confidence and aſſurance in the merits of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> I deſire you that you would be ſilent and joyne in Prayers with me; and I truſt in GOD that we ſhall all meet and live eternally in Heaven, there to receive the accompliſhment of all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, where every teare ſhall be wiped from our eyes, and every ſad thought from our hearts: And ſo God bleſſe this Kingdome, and <hi>Ieſus</hi> have mercy upon my Soule.</p>

            <p>THen turning himſelfe about, he ſaluted all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen, and tooke a ſolemne leave of all conſiderable perſons on the Scaffold, giving them his hand.</p>
            <p>And after that he ſaid, Gentlemen, I would ſay my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and I intreat you all to pray with me, and for me; then his Chaplaine laid the booke of Common prayer upon the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:137087:6"/> Chaire before him as he kneeled down, on which he prayed almoſt a quarter of an houre, then he prayed as long or longer without a booke, and ended with the Lords prayer; then ſtanding up he ſpies his brother Sir <hi>George Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> and calls him to him, and ſaith, brother wee muſt part, remember me to my ſiſter, and to my wife, and carry my bleſſing to my eldeſt Son, and charge him from mee, that he feare God and continue an obedient Sonne of the Church of England, and that he ſhould approve himſelfe a faithfull ſubject to the King, and tell him that he ſhould not have any private grudge or revenge towards any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me, and bid him beware that he meddle not with Church livings, for that will prove a moath and canker to him in his eſtate, and wiſh him to content himſelfe to be a ſervant to his Countrey, as a Juſtice of peace in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not aiming at higher preferments; carry my bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing alſo to my daughters, <hi>Anne</hi> and <hi>Arrabella,</hi> charge them to feare and ſerve God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he will bleſſe them, not forgetting my little Infant that yet knowes neither good nor evill, and cannot ſpeake for it ſelfe, God ſpeake for it and bleſſe it; then ſaid he, now I have nigh done, one ſtroke will make my wife husbandleſſe, my deare children father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and my poore ſervants maſterleſſe, and ſeperate mee from my deare brother and all my friends, but let God be to you and them, all in all.</p>
            <p>After that, going to take off his dublet, and to make himſelfe unready, he ſaid, <hi>I thanke God I am no more afraid of death, nor daunted with any diſcouragements riſing from any feares, but doe as chearefully put off my dublet at this time, as ever I did when I went to bed.</hi> Then he put off his dublet, and wound up his haire with his hands, and put on a white Cap.</p>
            <p>Then he called, Where is the man that ſhould doe this laſt office? (meaning the Executioner) call him to mee. When he came and askt him forgiveneſſe, he told him hee
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:137087:6"/> forgave him and all the world. Then kneeling downe by the block, he went to prayer again himſelfe, the Biſhop of Armach kneeling on the one ſide, and the Miniſter on the other; to the which Miniſter after prayer he turned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and ſpoke ſome few words ſoftly, having his hands lifted up: this Miniſter cloſed his hands with his; then bowing himſelfe to the earth to lay his head on the block, he told the Executioner that he would firſt lay downe his head to try the fitneſſe of the block, and take it up againe before he would lay it downe for good and all, and ſo hee did: and before he laid it downe againe, he told the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner that he would give him warning when to ſtrike, by ſtretching forth his hands; and then laid down his neck on the block, ſtretching out his hands, the Executioner ſtrucke off his head at one blow, then took the head up in his hands, and ſhewed it to all the people, and ſaid, <hi>God ſave the King.</hi>
