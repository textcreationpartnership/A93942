            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honourable, and the re≈øt, you are now come to convey me to my death: I am willing to die, which is a thing no more than all our Predece≈ø≈øors have done, and a debt that our Po≈øterity mu≈øt in their due time di≈øcharge, which ≈øince it can be no way avoyded, it ought the le≈ø≈øe to be feared; for that which is common to all, ought not to be intollerable to any: It is the Law of Nature, the tribute of the fle≈øh, remedy from all worldly cares and troubles; and to the truly penitent, a perfect path to ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe. And there is but one death, though ≈øeverall wayes unto it: mine is not naturall, but enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Law and Iu≈øtice: It hath been ≈øaid that the Lawes vex one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the meaner ≈øort of people, but the mighty are able to defend them: it is not ≈øo with me, for to the Law I ≈øubmit my ≈øelfe, and confe≈ø≈øe that I receive nothing but Iu≈øtice: for he that politikly intendeth good to a Common-weale, may be called a ju≈øt man, but he that practi≈øeth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his owne profit, or any other ≈øini≈øter ends, may be well tearmed a delinquent per≈øon; neither is delay in puni≈øhment any priviledge for pardon. And moreover, I ingenuou≈øly confe≈ø≈øe with <hi>Cicero,</hi> That the death of the bad is the ≈øafety of the good that be alive.</p>
                  <p>Let no man tru≈øt either in the favour of his Prince, the friend≈øhip and con≈øanguinity of his Peeres, much le≈ø≈øe in his owne wi≈øedome and knowledge, of which I ingenuou≈øly confe≈ø≈øe I have been too confident. Kings, as they are men before God, ≈øo they are Gods before men, and I may ≈øay with a great man once in this Kingdome, <hi>Had I ≈øtrived to obey my God as faithfully, as I ≈øought to honour my King diligently, I had ≈øtood, and not fallen.</hi> Mo≈øt happy and fortunate is that Prince, who is as much for his ju≈øtice feared, as for his goodne≈ø≈øe beloved: For the greater that Princes are in power above other, the more they ought in vertue to excell other; and ≈øuch is the Royall Soveraigne whom I late ≈øerved.</p>
                  <p>For my Peeres, the corre≈øpondence that I had with them during my pro≈øperity, was to me very delightfull and plea≈øing, and here they have commi≈øerated my ruine, I have plentifully found, who (for the mo≈øt generous of them) I may boldly ≈øay, though they have dete≈øted the fact, yet they have pittied the per≈øon delinquent; the fir≈øt in their loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the la≈øt in their Charity: ingenuou≈øly confe≈ø≈øing, that never any ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:137087:3"/> or Peere of my rank, had ever that helpe of Coun≈øell, that benefit of time, or a more free and legall tryall than I have had: in the like whereof, none of my predece≈ø≈øors hath had ≈øo much favour from his Prince, ≈øo much ≈øufferance from the people; in which I comprehend the under≈øtanding Commons, not the many headed Mon≈øter, Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: But I have offended, am ≈øentenced, and mu≈øt now ≈øuffer.</p>
                  <p>And for my too much confidence in my ≈øuppo≈øed wi≈ødom &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, therein have bin the mo≈øt deceived: for he is wi≈øe to him≈øelf, that knowes by others faults to correct his owne offences: to be truely wi≈øe is to be Secretaries to our ≈øelves; for it is meere folly to reveale our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate thoughts to ≈øtrangers: wi≈ødom is the mo≈øt precious Gem with which the mind can be adorned, and learning the mo≈øt famous thing for which a man ought to be e≈øteemed, and true wi≈ødome teacheth us to doe well, as to ≈øpeake well: in the fir≈øt I have failed, for <hi>the wi≈ødome of man is fooli≈øhne≈ø≈øe with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For knowledge, it is a thing indifferent both to good and evill, but the be≈øt knowledge is for a man to know him≈øelfe; hee that doth ≈øo ≈øhall e≈øteeme of him≈øelfe but little, for he con≈øidereth from whence hee came, and whereto he mu≈øt goe, he regardeth not the vaine plea≈øures of this life, he exalteth God, and ≈øtrives to live in his feare; but hee that knoweth not him≈øelfe, is wilfull in his own wayes, unprofitable in his life, unfortunate in his death, and ≈øo am I. But the rea≈øon why I ≈øought to attaine unto it, was this: I have read that he that knoweth not that which he ought to know, is a bruit bea≈øt among men; hee that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more than he ought to know, is a man among≈øt bea≈øts: but hee that knoweth all that may be known, is a God among≈øt men. To this I much a≈øpired, in this I much failed; <hi>Vanity of vanities, all is but vanity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have heard the people clamour and cry out, ≈øaying, That through my occa≈øion the times are bad, I wi≈øh that when I am dead they may prove better: mo≈øt true it is, that there is at this time a great ≈øtorme impending (God in his mercy avert it.) And ≈øince it is my particular lot, like <hi>Ionah,</hi> to be ca≈øt into the ≈øea, I ≈øhall thinke my life well ≈øpent, to appea≈øe Gods wrath, and ≈øatisfie the peoples malice.</p>
                  <p>O what is eloquence more than ayre? fa≈øhioned with an articulate and di≈øtinct ≈øound, when it is a ≈øpeciall vertue to ≈øpeake little and well, and ≈øilence is oft the be≈øt Oratory; for fools in their dumbne≈ø≈øe may be accounted wi≈øe: It hath power to make a good matter ≈øeeme bad, and a bad cau≈øe appeare good: but mine was to me unprofitable, and like the Cypre≈ø≈øe trees, which are great and tall, but altogether without fruit.</p>
                  <p>What is honour? but the fir≈øt ≈øtep to di≈øquietne≈ø≈øe, and power is ≈øtill
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:137087:3"/> waited on by envy, neither hath it any priviledge again≈øt infamy. It is held to be the chiefe part of honour, for a man to joyne to his office and calling; curte≈øie and affability, commi≈øeration and pitty: for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he draweth to him with a kind of compul≈øion, the hearts of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. But that was the lea≈øt part of my ≈øtudy, which now makes me call to minde, that the greater the per≈øons are in authority, the ≈øoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they are catcht in any delinquency, and their ≈ømalle≈øt crimes are thought to be Capitall, the ≈ømalle≈øt ≈øpot ≈øeems great in the fine≈øt linen, and the lea≈øt flaw is ≈øoone≈øt found in the riche≈øt Diamond. But high and Noble ≈øpirits finding them≈øelves wounded, grieve not ≈øo much at their owne paine and perplexity, as at the deri≈øion and ≈øcoffes of their enemy: but for mine own part, though I might have many in my life, I hope to find none in my death.</p>
                  <p>Among≈øt other things which pollute and contaminate the minds of great ≈øpirits, there is none more hainous then Ambition, which is ≈øel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome unacompanied with Avarice: Such to po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe their ends, care not to violate the Lawes of Religion, and Rea≈øon, and to breake the bonds of Mode≈øty and Equity, with the neare≈øt tyes of Con≈øanguinity, and Amity; of which as I have beene guilty, ≈øo I crave at Gods hands forgivene≈ø≈øe. It is a Maxime in Philo≈øophy, that ambitious men can be never good Coun≈øellors to Princes; the de≈øire of having more is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to great Lords, and a de≈øire of Rule a great cau≈øe of their Ruine.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, I am now the hopele≈ø≈øe Pre≈øident, may I be to you all an happy example: For Ambition devoureth gold, and drinketh blood, and climbeth ≈øo high by other mens heads, that at the length in the fall, it breaketh its owne neck: therefore it is better to live in humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, than in high care and trouble: For more precious is want with hone≈øty, than wealth with infamy: For what are we but meere Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, which in a ≈øerene Element a≈øcend high, and upon an in≈øtant, like Smoake vani≈øh into nothing: or like ≈øhips without Pilots, to≈øt up and downe upon the Seas by contrary winds and tempe≈øts. But the good husbandman thinkes better of tho≈øe eares of Corne, which bow down, and grow crooked, than tho≈øe which are ≈øtraight and upright, becau≈øe he is a≈ø≈øured to finde more ≈øtore of Grain in the one than in the other. This all men know, yet of this, how few make u≈øe: The defect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of mu≈øt be now my pain: may my ≈øuffering prove to others profit.</p>
                  <p>For what hath now the favour of my Prince, the familiarity with my Peeres, the volubility of a tongue, the ≈øtrength of my memory, my learning, or knowledge, my honours, or Offices, my power, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, my riches, and trea≈øure, (all the≈øe the ≈øpeciall gifts, both of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Fortune) what have all the≈øe profited me? Ble≈ø≈øings I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:137087:4"/> though by God be≈øtowed upon man, yet not all of them together upon many: yet by the divine Providence, the mo≈øt of them met in me: of which had I made happy u≈øe, I might ≈øtill have flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øht, who now am forced immaturely to fall.</p>
                  <p>I now could wi≈øh, (but that <hi>utinam</hi> is too late) that God with his outward goodne≈ø≈øe towards me had ≈øo commixed his inward grace, that I had chu≈øed the <hi>medium</hi> path, neither inclining to the right hand, nor deviating to the left; but like <hi>Icarus</hi> with my waxen wings, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by too low a flight to moi≈øten them with the Waves: I ≈øoared too high, and too neare the Sun, by which they being melted, I aiming at the highe≈øt, am precipitated to the lowe≈øt, and am made a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prey to the Waters: But I who before built my hou≈øe upon the ≈øand, have now ≈øetled my hopes upon the Rock my Saviour: by who≈øe only merits my ≈øole tru≈øt is, that what≈øoever becomes of my body, yet in this bo≈øome my ≈øoule may be ≈øanctuaried.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nimrod</hi> would have built a Tower to reach up to heaven, and called it <hi>Babel;</hi> but God turned it to the confu≈øion of Languages, and di≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the people. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> kept the children of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> in Bondage and after having freed them, in his great pride would have made them his prey; but God gave them a dry and miraculous pa≈ø≈øage, and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> and his hoa≈øt a watry Sepulchre. <hi>Bel≈øhazzer</hi> fea≈øted his Princes and Pro≈øtitutes, who drunke healths in the Ve≈ø≈øels taken from the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but the hand of God writ upon the wall, <hi>Mene, Tekel, Phoras,</hi> and that night before morning, was both his kingdome and life taken from him: Thus God lets men go on a great while in their own devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but in the end it proves their own ruine and de≈øtruction, never ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering them to effect their de≈øired purpo≈øes: therefore let none pre≈øume upon his power, glory in his greatne≈ø≈øe, or be too confident in his riches: The≈øe things were written for our In≈øtruction, of which the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving may make u≈øe, the dying cannot; but wit and unfruitfull wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome are the next neighbours to folly.</p>
                  <p>There can be no greater vanity in the world, than to e≈øteeme the world, which regardeth no man; and to make ≈ølight account of God who greatly re≈øpecteth all men; and there can be no greater folly in man, than by much Travell to encrea≈øe his goods, and pamper his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and in the interim with vain delights and plea≈øures, to lo≈øe his ≈øoul. It is a great folly in any man to attempt a bad beginning, in hope of good ending; and to make that proper to one, which was before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, is meere indi≈øcretion, and the beginning of di≈øcord, which I po≈øitively wi≈øh may end in this my puni≈øhment.</p>
